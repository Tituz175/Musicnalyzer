True stories were, miracles were, true blessings were. I was riding in my car one day, in the express lane, rolling on the freeway. And suddenly the phone rings, then I wrenched down beside me. Then I looked on the floor, felt on the back seams. See, I was drinking while I was driving, never thinking about what I was doing. I turned around, and before I knew it, here comes this truck now. The doctor said, I don't think he's gonna make it. Family said, make the funeral arrangements. Unplug the machine, he's gone now. Then told my wife to be strong now. Then a small voice said unto me, if you promise to stop drinking. I surrendered on that day, and now for ten years I've been straight. You saved me. Oh. You saved me. You saved me. You saved me. Oh. You saved me. Thank you, Jesus. You gave me a second chance. Oh, no. You saved me. Thank you, Jesus. You saved me. Oh. You saved me. You saved me. Now, I've been sitting in this chair, waiting on the phone to ring. Praying up to God that someone would call me with a job opening. Cause it's been so hard for me month to month. So hard. Struggling to eat. But still there was no answer. No answer. I stopped believing in his word and got so mad at him. And when somebody say God's good, I just laugh at him all. In the nick of time, his blessings rained on me. Why is grace the phone ring? A lady says we're hiring. And that's when I knew you saved me. Save. You saved me. Oh. You saved me. Oh, no. You saved me. Thank you. You saved me. Now, I was 18 out there on the block selling drugs. With a gun at my waist and for people I had no love. See, the streets was my home and family and friends were gone. Had no one to trust. And deep inside I was all alone. And then a deal went bad one day and it was enough to pause me. I was shot four times. And before I knew it, I was on my knees. I'm pushing out my body, my heart's beating fast. I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't think I'm going to last. Then I began to flash back on the things I've done in my past. And I was my voice that said to me, I'll give you peace if you believe. I accepted Christ that day. Hallelujah. Now, I'm free. You saved me. Save me. You saved me. Thank you. Thank you. You saved me. Whoa. Whoa. You saved me. You saved me. I was in the aisle of the grocery store. Mm-hmm. With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering where did it come from. I got tested. And the results came back and the doctor said, I'm sorry, but you've got cancer. I could not believe it. So I called up my mama to calm my nerves. Mama. She got down on her knees. Mama. She said a prayer for me. Mama. Said just keep on thanking Jesus. Mama. And he'll give you all you need. Thank you, Jesus. And that was five years ago. Thank you, Jesus. Don't have that pain no more. Thank you, Jesus. Doc says you can go home. Thank you, Jesus. Cause all your cancer's gone. You saved me. Said you saved me. You saved me. You saved me. No. You saved me. You saved me. You saved me. Oh. But you saved me. You saved me. Whoa. You saved me. You saved me. You saved me. You saved me. Gave me a second chance. You saved me. You saved me. Hallelujah. You saved me. You saved me. You saved me. You saved man. Whoa- augmented you saved... You saved me. You saved man. You saved man. You saved me. You saved me. Sab... you saved man. You saved man. You gave me a second chance. It was by grace. You saved me. You saved me. You saved Me... And I'm so thankful... You saved me. You saved man. You look down on me and saw me standing there I was at the end of my road, yeah, with nowhere to go And you gave the evening, I was down and out to you I was doing drugs to you, I was running the streets to you Never felt love to you, I was saving until you saved me I went out to you, I'm sorry you've been How did you stop that? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh You sign me Thank you.
